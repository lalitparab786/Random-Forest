# Random-Forest Classifier
**Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm which is based on ensemble learning. In this kernel, I build Random Forest Classifier model to predict whether a person having what kind of salary. I have demonstrated the feature selection process using the Random Forest model to find only the important features, rebuild the model using these features and see its effect on accuracy. I have used the HR-Dataset for this project.**
